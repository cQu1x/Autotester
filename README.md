### Project Goal(s) and Description
The goal of the project is to create a simple and accessible tool for checking websites for basic interface elements such as fields, buttons, and headings. The user enters a URL and specifies what needs to be checked, and the system runs an automated test and provides a result in the form of ✅/❌ for each question.
